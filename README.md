# STREAM PROCESSING WITH ACTORS

## üìë INTRODUCTION

### General

Compared to the previous Project, all weeks for this one aim to build upon the same application.
The goal is to finish the Project with a more or less functional stream processing system.
Since you will be working on a complex application, each presentation will now require you
present 2 diagrams: a `Message Flow Diagram` and a `Supervision Tree Diagram`. The Message
Flow Diagram describes the message exchange between actors of your system whereas the
Supervision Tree Diagram analyzes the monitor structures of your application.
Every task you work on should be easily verifiable. Your system should provide logs about
starting / stopping actors, auto-scaling / load balancing workers and printing processed tweets
on screen.
